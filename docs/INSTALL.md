# Install EverWrapMCP

EverWrapMCP currently runs on **macOS** and uses macOS Keychain for Evernote credentials.
Windows/Linux and a one-click extension package are not supported by this build.
The repository is public and MIT-licensed; collaborator access is not required.

Not sure which client path you need? Read [the compatibility guide](CLIENT_COMPATIBILITY.md).
Codex is optional; ordinary ChatGPT cloud chat does not inherit local MCP registration.

## Install the runtime

Install Git and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/crfgxr/everwrapmcp.git
cd everwrapmcp
uv sync --python 3.12
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements-live.txt
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m everwrap.language
```

The project supports Python 3.12–3.13. Model installation downloads public weights;
redaction runs locally. Keep the checkout in a stable location because client
configurations point to it. Run later commands from this directory unless noted.

## Configure and sign in

For a **new checkout**, copy the example:

```sh
cp single-note.example.json .everwrap-local.json
chmod 600 .everwrap-local.json
```

Create a synthetic note in Evernote. Edit `.everwrap-local.json`, replacing the
placeholder with that note's GUID and setting `content_mode` to `redacted`:

```json
{
  "allowed_note_id": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DUMMY_NOTE_UUID",
  "blocked_note_ids": [],
  "access_mode": "single_note",
  "content_mode": "redacted"
}
```

To obtain the link, see [the Mac menu-bar and shortcut steps](ONBOARDING.md#choose-the-notes-to-block).
Use Copy internal link, not public sharing.

For an internal link shaped like `evernote:///view/ACCOUNT/SHARD/NOTE_GUID/OTHER_GUID`,
use `NOTE_GUID`, the first UUID after the shard. Keep actual IDs and links private.
Then authenticate the **wrapper**, not a separate direct Evernote connector:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m everwrap.connect
```

Approve read-only access in the browser. If it doesn't open, use the link printed
by the command on the same Mac. Successful setup prints `Connected. No notes were
read.` and the read-tool schema. The callback uses `127.0.0.1:8766`; leave the command
running until it completes. Tokens are stored in macOS Keychain, not the JSON file.
[Evernote's official MCP guide](https://dev.evernote.com/mcp) describes account access
and OAuth. There is no Evernote API key to paste into the client configuration.

## Claude Desktop

In Claude Desktop, open **Settings → Developer → Edit Config**. On macOS this edits
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`. Merge the following
entry into any existing `mcpServers` object; keep your other entries. Replace both
absolute paths with your checkout location. You can run `pwd -P` there to find it.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "everwrap": {
      "command": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/everwrapmcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "everwrap.server"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/everwrapmcp/src"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Save and fully quit/reopen Claude Desktop. Check that EverWrapMCP exposes
`read_safe_note`, `search_safe_notes`, and `semantic_search_safe_notes`. This is local developer configuration,
not an extension-directory listing or a remote connector URL.
[Official local-server instructions](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-local-servers).
These setup steps are documentation-checked, but this project's Claude Desktop
integration has not been tested in a live Claude session.

## Claude Code

With Claude Code installed, run from the EverWrapMCP checkout:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user everwrap --env "PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src" -- "$PWD/.venv/bin/python" -m everwrap.server
```

Open Claude Code and use `/mcp` to inspect the connection. User scope keeps this
registration out of the project's shared MCP config. This follows the
[official stdio setup](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp); live Claude verification
remains outstanding.

## ChatGPT

**Advanced; not yet tested with EverWrapMCP.** ChatGPT can reach local stdio servers
through [Secure MCP Tunnel](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/secure-mcp-tunnels).
EverWrapMCP does not provide a public HTTP endpoint.

1. In [Platform tunnel settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/tunnels),
   create a tunnel associated with your ChatGPT workspace. Obtain the necessary
   tunnel permissions, runtime API key, and `tunnel_id`.
2. Install `tunnel-client` using the download linked in those settings. Supply
   `CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY` in your shell; don't commit it. On the same Mac where
   EverWrapMCP is authenticated, replace the ID and paths below:

```sh
tunnel-client init \
  --sample sample_mcp_stdio_local \
  --profile everwrap \
  --tunnel-id YOUR_TUNNEL_ID \
  --mcp-command '/usr/bin/env "PYTHONPATH=/ABSOLUTE/PATH/everwrapmcp/src" "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/everwrapmcp/.venv/bin/python" -m everwrap.server'

tunnel-client doctor --profile everwrap --explain
tunnel-client run --profile everwrap
```

Keep that process running. The tunnel setup above follows OpenAI's
[stdio quickstart](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/secure-mcp-tunnels#set-up-tunnel-client).

3. Enable ChatGPT developer mode in **Settings → Security and login** if available.
   In [ChatGPT Plugins](https://chatgpt.com/plugins), use **+**, choose **Tunnel** under
   Connection, and select or enter your tunnel ID. Review the discovered tools,
   then add the connection to a new conversation. Availability depends on your
   account and workspace policy.
   [Official connection steps](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/connect-chatgpt).

Use the EverWrapMCP process as the tunnel target. Pointing ChatGPT directly at the
Evernote MCP endpoint bypasses this wrapper's block list and redaction.

## Codex

From the checkout, with the Codex CLI installed:

```sh
codex mcp add everwrap --env "PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src" -- "$PWD/.venv/bin/python" -m everwrap.server
```

Restart the MCP connection or Codex. The CLI registration and live stdio calls
have been verified in this project. This is separate from ChatGPT's tunnel setup.

## First test

Ask your client:

> Use EverWrapMCP to read my synthetic test note by its configured GUID. Summarize
> the returned text and tell me whether it contains masking placeholders.

Confirm that the returned `content_mode` is `redacted` and the note body is plain
text. Test a blocked ID too: it should return a static policy denial. No request
should fetch the blocked note's body. Search may receive blocked metadata locally;
EverWrapMCP discards that row before returning anything to the assistant.

## Allow more notes

After testing, edit only the **private local file** if you want account-wide access
with exclusions:

```json
{
  "access_mode": "denylist",
  "content_mode": "redacted",
  "blocked_note_ids": ["REPLACE_WITH_A_NOTE_UUID_TO_BLOCK"]
}
```

Replace the placeholder with your own blocked UUID. Use `[]` only if you intend
no explicit exclusions. The list supports up to 16 UUIDs. An explicit block always
wins. Never paste actual IDs, account links, tokens, or note text into commits or
issues. `.everwrap-local.json` must stay both ignored and untracked.

The server reloads policy on each call; code changes require a server restart.
`blocked` disables content access. `unredacted` intentionally skips masking and
returns original permitted text. Client tool arguments cannot change these modes.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Python/module not found | Use absolute paths; reinstall `requirements-live.txt` after any `uv sync`. |
| Configuration error | Replace placeholder UUIDs and validate local JSON. |
| Content blocked | Check `content_mode`, runtime/model installation, and the local OAuth setup. There is no raw fallback. |
| Sign-in fails | Retry `everwrap.connect`; check network access and localhost port 8766. |
| Old tool descriptions | Restart the MCP process; refresh the ChatGPT connection if applicable. |
| Tunnel not visible | Check workspace association and tunnel permissions in the official tunnel guide. |

Keep direct Evernote connectors removed when the wrapper should be the only note
interface. This does not prevent bypass by an agent that can modify local code or
access credentials. Masking is best-effort; processed text is sent to your AI
provider. Read [redaction limits](REDACTION.md) before using personal notes.

Long notes use [local section selection and masked pages](LARGE_NOTES.md).
The default read returns up to 4,000 body characters; ask for the latest recognized
dated entry or a keyword-matching section to avoid retrieving the whole journal.
Restart the MCP connection after updating so the client sees the new read options.
The updated server also exposes `semantic_search_safe_notes` for meaning-based
retrieval in redacted denylist mode. [Semantic search guide](SEMANTIC_SEARCH.md).

## Run the checks

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --ignore=tests/test_release_gate.py -q
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m experiments.redaction
```

The historical stock-baseline command is separate and intentionally retains its
six known failures:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_release_gate.py -q
```

See [results](RESULTS.md) for the distinction between access-control tests,
redaction regressions, and the original baseline. Client instructions were checked
against official documentation on 2026-09-17; UI labels and account access can change.
